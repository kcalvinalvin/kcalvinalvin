### I am a Water deer

I'm a water deer that likes Linux and Bitcoin. I know Bitcoin better though.

Usually I am:

- Contributing to Bitcoin
- Tweaking my NixOS servers
- Looking for cool FOSS projects
- Drinking water

I'm available for coffee in Seoul if you wanna talk Bitcoin or Linux (email calvin@kcalvinalvin.info).
I am not available for hire.
