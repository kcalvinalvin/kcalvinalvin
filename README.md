### ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Calvin ðŸ‘‹

I am an open source developer that works on scaling Bitcoin.

Nowadays I'm usually:

- Working on utreexod (github.com/utreexo/utreexod), a Bitcoin full node with Utreexo accumulators
- Working on utreexo (github.com/mit-dci/utreexo), a dynamic hash-based accumulator for Bitcoin
- Drinking water as I'm a water deer

I'm dabbling around in:

- Contributing to libutreexo (github.com/mit-dci/libutreexo), an implementation of utreexo in C++
- Porting the work I've done in utcd to Bitcoin Core

If you'd like to talk to me or send me pictures of cute water deers, I'm reachable at calvin@kcalvinalvin.info!
