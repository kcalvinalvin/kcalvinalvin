### ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Calvin ðŸ‘‹

I am an open source developer based in Seoul that works on scaling Bitcoin.

Nowadays I'm usually:

- Working on [utreexod](https://github.com/utreexo/utreexod), a Bitcoin full node with Utreexo accumulators
- Working on [utreexo](https://github.com/utreexo/utreexo), a dynamic hash-based accumulator for Bitcoin
- Working on [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd), a bitcoin implementation in Go
- Being a water deer
  
If you'd like to talk/grab a coffee with me or send me pictures of cute water deers, I'm reachable at calvin@calvinkim.info!
